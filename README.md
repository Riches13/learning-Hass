I want to do some limited home automation using Home Assistant, starting with rtl-sdr and rtl_433
simple, eh? Like stumbling into a swamp.  Currently I am sinking with the need for an access token of some sort to get rtl_433.git
Not to worry, I'll thrash around and either get out or stumble onto what I need.
First, of course, I need to learn what github is and does and the steps involved. Iterative crash-and-burn.
Then rtl_433
Then mqtt
Then ?? -- haven't gotten that far, yet; yaml is in there somewhere and the concepts involved with configs, etc.
Fascinating, what I've already learned about Raspberry Pi & raspi-*.
